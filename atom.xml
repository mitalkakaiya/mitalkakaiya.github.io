    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>WHO ARE YOU?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m Mital Kakaiya, and am living in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

<h3>WORK EXPERIENCE?</h3>

<p>I am working as Technical Lead / Senior Software Developer in financial/accounting field. I have over 10+ years of experience in enterprise application development using Microsoft tools and technologies. Expert in .NET Framework, C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, WCF, WPF, XML, SQL Server, Windows Azure (Cloud). Extensive experience in financial, accounting &amp; ERP projects. Also, I have acquired Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD) for .NET Framework.</p>

<h3>EDUCATION?</h3>

<p>I have always been fascinated by computers, and since I was in school I knew I would end up in a career working with them. I completed my degree in Electronics and learnt internals of computer processors and their CPU activities to process instructions given by programming languages. To enhance my career in the computing field, I completed Master of Engineering in Information Technology from RMIT University, Melbourne.</p>

<h3>WHY BLOG?</h3>

<p>I read lots of books, programming blogs and technical articles daily, which helps me to learn new skills and explore ideas. I think this blog will help me to improve my skills further by sharing my thoughts &amp; knowledge to everyone, and hopefully it will help others too. Also, Writing a blog entry is a challenge for me and a commitment to myself to keep thinking, questioning, and finding new insights that are worth sharing.</p>
